                  Chicken Tinola is a Filipino soup dish. It involves cooking
                  chicken pieces in ginger broth. It is a popular cold weather
                  dish. I always feel warm and cozy every time I eat it. This
                  Filipino Chicken Soup is best enjoyed with fish sauce as
                  dipping sauce, and a cup of warm white rice.

                  chicken slices. It is best served when topped with hard boiled
                  eggs, some chopped scallions, and toasted or roasted garlic. I
                  personally like to squeeze a piece of calamansi or lime over
                  the toppings. It makes the dish taste fresher and delicious.

                  Chicken Pancit Medley is an easy chicken pancit recipe that is

                  This delicious pancit dish is quick and easy to make. It is
                  also budget-friendly.

                  Lumpiang Togue is a variation of the spring roll. Instead of
                  meat, Mung bean sprouts (locally known as togue) are used as

                  snack in the Philippines and it is best eaten when dipped in
                  spicy vinegar with onions and whole peppercorn.

                  Sinigang is another classic Filipino dish that is well-loved
                  by, of course, the Filipinos. This sour soup can brighten a
                  gloomy day and Pinoys would even have this even on a hot
                  summer night! Seriously, that’s how much they love this dish.

                  Crispy Tofu Sisig is a dish composed of deep fried tofu cubes,
                  chopped chili peppers, and onion. It is healthier alternative
                  to traditional pork sisig because it does not use any meat and
                  greasy ingredients. Aside from being healthy, this crispy tofu
                  sisig recipe is also vegan.
